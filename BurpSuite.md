# 🛠️ Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a professional toolkit I used during TryHackMe labs for *real-world web penetration testing*.

---

## 🔹 Core Features
- *Proxy* → Captured and inspected HTTP/S traffic to find hidden headers, cookies, and tokens.  
- *Repeater* → Modified and replayed requests to confirm vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection).  
- *Intruder* → Automated brute force and fuzzing to discover weak logins & hidden parameters.  
- *Extensions* → Used tools like Logger++ & Autorize for privilege escalation and authorization bypass testing.

## 🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Capturing and manipulating live traffic for testing.  
- Manual + automated testing workflow using Burp tools.  
- Exploiting *SQL Injection, XSS, Authentication Bypass*.  
- Applying extensions for advanced pentesting scenarios.

## 📂 Example Workflow
1. Intercept traffic with *Proxy*.  
2. Send suspicious requests to *Repeater*.  
3. Test payloads manually and confirm vulnerabilities.  
4. Launch *Intruder* for brute force or fuzzing.  
5. Log results for documentation & reporting.
